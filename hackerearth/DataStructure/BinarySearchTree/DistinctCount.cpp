Given an array A of N integers, classify it as being Good Bad or Average. It is called Good, if it contains exactly X distinct integers, Bad if it contains less than X distinct integers and Average if it contains more than X distinct integers.

Input format:
First line consists of a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.
First line of each test case consists of two space separated integers denoting N and X.
Second line of each test case consists of N space separated integers denoting the array elements.

Output format:
Print the required answer for each test case on a new line.
