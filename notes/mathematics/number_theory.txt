Properties of modulo operations.

        Some of the properties of modulo are:
        (a+b)%c = (a%c + b%c )%c. 
        (a * b)%c = ((a%c) * (b%c))%c.
        
        
        Example:
        Letâ€™s say a = 5, b = 3, c = 2.
        Then:
        1) (5+3)%2 = 8%2 = 0. 
        Similarly (5%2 + 3%2)%2 = (1 + 1)%2 = 0.
        2) (5 * 3)%2 = 15%2 = 1.
        Similarly ( (5%2) * (3%2) )%2 = (1 * 1)%2 = 1.
